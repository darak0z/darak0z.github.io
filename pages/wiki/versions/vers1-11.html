                >- TWO new Chambers: 
                - <a href="/pages/wiki/chambers/ch-hootEternal-fr.html">HOOT ETERNAL: SHOOTING RANGE</a>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This is a small chamber to test out the weapons of Time Trial I, without 60 enemies following you.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This chamber includes: The 6 weapons available in Time Trial I, test dummies, a target range, a lounge area, (near) infinite ammo, and secrets!
                - <a href="/pages/wiki/chambers/ch-customRobonov.html">Robonov Customization</a>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In this Chamber you can customize your Robonov (playable character) however you want!
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- You can customize: Antenna Color, Button Color, Spring Color, Face Expression, and a Hat Accessory!
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- As a reminder, press TAB to enter photo mode, and see your Robonov.
                - Added a Spanish translation!
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- NOTE: If you're in a chamber, you need to Restart [R] it to update the language.
                - Added a sound upon completing the Maze areas and the Block Puzzle.
                - Added descriptions to the Badges in the main menu upon hovering on them.
                - Reverted the Halloween decorations.

                - Added even MORE loading screen tips.
                - Fixed a slight game freeze when talking to the <a href="/pages/wiki/characters/char-antiago.html">Antiago</a> NPC.
                - Exaggerated the animation of the Antiago NPC a bit more.
                - HOOT ETERNAL Changes/Additions:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Fixed enemies starting to "drift" when they get stunned
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Lightly reduced the range of the Machete. It still attacks in a wide angle, just lightly less far away.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Machete can now attack multiple enemies in one swing.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Renamed the "Sniper Rifle" to "Lever Action Sniper"
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Corrected the position of damage numbers caused by melee attacks.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Moved the ammo pop up upwards to avoid blocking the player's vision.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Added a Win screen upon getting all kills in a Time Trial. This also stops the timer, so you can roam around freely.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Increased the damage of Dynamites by 12 (80 -> 92)
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Decreased the fuse time of Dynamites by 0.5s (2.5s -> 2.0s)
