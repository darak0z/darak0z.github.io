                >Released on September 10th, 2019.
                There's no devlog to this update so the patch notes are lost to time.
                But I compared the two builds and saw a few differences between 1.0 and 1.1
                Below are the differences between the two in replacement for "Patch Notes".

                <div id="comparison">
                1- A Bridge was added in-between the two playable rooms.
                And due to the inclusion of the bridge, the two rooms were moved from each other.

                2- The Pose of the Smirnov Ragdoll is different.
