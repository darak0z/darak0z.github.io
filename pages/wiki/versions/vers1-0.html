                And then released on <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> the next day, September 10th, 2019.
                It's the first ever release, you have the basic prop pick-up system,
                a few props, and the main chamber, which at the time was the only chamber.

                Screenshot #1,
                Smirnov, with his old design, sitting near the campfire.
                You can see a distorsion on his face caused by heat particles.

                Screenshot #2,
                An easter egg on the other side of Smirnov's mask, 
                It says 'CXFAI', the name of the dev group behind tChamber.

                This thing was going to be a Cassette Player.
                It never got implemented, until 1.7 added the "Music Card" system,
                which then got changed to Cassettes in the <i>development</i> of 1.8,
                and then to its final iteration in the <i>release</i> of 1.8, the Vinyl Player

                Video #1,
                Heat particles mentioned in Screenshot 1 are seen.

                Video #2,
                Same as before, but Smirnov has been moved inside the room.

                Video #3,
                Footage of the Smirnov Ragdoll and the Playermodel.
