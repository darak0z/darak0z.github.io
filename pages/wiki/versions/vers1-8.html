                >Released on August 15th, 2021.
                After a year-long pause, motivation came back (thank you Owlface_ & Haeyloss), development of the game resumed and 1.8 was released.
                Post processing was added (specifically Ambient Occlusion),
                the main chamber was redesigned/revamped,
                and the vinyl player from 1.0 was finally implemented.
