                >MAJOR HOOT ETERNAL UPDATE
                - Added a main menu, with a level select, class select, it's own theme song, and much more.
                - Added a CLASSES system to HOOT ETERNAL
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Each class has different stats (Health, Speed, Passive Skills, Active Skills). You can see all of this in the HOOT ETERNAL Main Menu.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Four classes are currently available: <a href="/pages/wiki/owldoom/classes/class-factorynew.html">The Factory-New</a>, <a href="/pages/wiki/owldoom/classes/class-agile.html">The Agile</a>, <a href="/pages/wiki/owldoom/classes/class-tank.html">The Tank</a>, and <a href="/pages/wiki/owldoom/classes/class-reckless.html">The Reckless</a>.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Selecting a class DOES NOT override your customization options.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A class quick-switcher is also available in-game by pressing Esc and selecting the desired class in the menu on the top.
                - The <a href="/pages/wiki/owldoom/weapons/wpn-revolver.html">Revolver</a> now has a unique shooting animation and a slight remodel.
                - The <a href="/pages/wiki/owldoom/weapons/wpn-dynamites.html">Dynamites</a> now have a unique throwing animation.
                - Remade the explosion particles and reduced the clutter they caused.
                - Added an "Autorun" option (Run by default, Walk by holding shift) to the settings menu. Works outside of HOOT too!
                - Melee Rewrite
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Melee attacks are more consistent now.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Added Melee damage randomization, like the other weapons.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In addition to this, Melee attacks now have a 10% chance of being a Crit, dealing 1.35x damage, indicated by a yellow damage number.
                - Improvements to the HUD
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Shortened "HEALTH" as "HP".
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Changed "TIME" and "KEYS" to icons.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Removed "WEAPON" text and lowered the sprite to accommodate.
                - Overhauled the Crosshair, it now represents the accuracy of your weapon rather than simply being a static image.
                
                BASE GAME CHANGES
                - Remade the Main Menu's UI with a much better look and new options.
                - Added a FOV slider and a "Show Controls" button to the Settings menu.
                - You can now also crouch by holding C (Ctrl still works)
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- To accommodate for this, the Zoom In/Out keys have been swapped from C/Z to X/Z
                - Added Competitive Mode™ to select chambers
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Available in the Maze levels, and the Block Puzzle
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tracks your time and saves your best time after beating the level.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Press [G] to enable Competitive Mode™
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Press [V] to delete your Best Time
                - New Cosmetics:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 8 Antenna Shapes
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 26 Hats
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 14 Faces
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 3 Unlockable Cosmetics
                - New Styles for existing Cosmetics:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Antenna Shape: Stars (Four Point)
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Face: Angry (Symbol)
                - Cosmetics with extra styles now have the styles as smaller buttons, to avoid cluttering the UI.
                - Improved the models of the Lalo and Devilnov NPCs
